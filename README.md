# Teleoperated-Control-of-A-Robotic-Arm-For-On-Orbit-Servicing 

**Abstract** 
In this thesis, a graphical user interface is designed, developed for user to control the robotic arm (Universal Robots, UR10) remotely on-orbit servicing. The GUI acts like a bridge in between the robotic arm and user control as an input to operate the manipulator. UR10 is selected as a robotic arm. As a serial manipulator that has 6 degree of freedom, it is ideal to perform the pick and place job. User will be able to control the robotics arm to perform on-orbit servicing through GUI that linked to robotic simulator by joystick, keyboard and mouse. Hence, an intuitive, easy to operate, functional GUI is designed and programmed to cater to the needs on the operation that can be per-formed as a robotic arm in space. The main purpose of this project is to allow the user to control the robot manipulator and to demonstrate the capabilities of the robot arm to perform its tasks in space debris removal. In space debris removal, a remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with, capture and return debris to a central station.

**Objctive**
1. Study space debris removal is necessary and understand teleoperating a robotic manipula-tor in space.  
2. To identify the desired characteristics and design relevant feature in a teleoperating control interface should provide for the user, with respect to:  
    • Motion control  
    • Visual information from the robot/environment  
    • Applied force and environment interaction  
    • Robot state and diagnostics  
3. Designing of the interface in a simulated environment  
    • MATLAB App Designer  
    • V-REP simulator  
4. Evaluation on real robotic testbed, on an example test case  
    • STAR Lab Orbital Robotics Testbed
